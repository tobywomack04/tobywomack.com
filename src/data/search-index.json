This website is a personal project of mine, meticulously built from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while also integrating modern tools such as GitHub Actions and Google Analytics. Its primary purpose is to serve as both a digital portfolio and a development sandbox ‚Äî a space where I can showcase my previous projects and experiment with new and interesting features. One of the key features of this site is a custom-built search system that allows you to find any content across my pages ‚Äî fully client-side and fast. Unlike typical portfolios, this site also functions as a living development log ‚Äî complete with versioning, real-time updates, and experimental features I'm actively building and testing. Make sure to check back in the future as this site is constantly evolving, fresh new projects and updates are added regularly! Within this website you can explore: A curated selection of both college and personal projects, complete with links to the respective GitHub repositories A live feed of my most recent GitHub project activity Contact details for personal and professional inquiries External links to social platforms including GitHub, LinkedIn and YouTube Use the navigation bar above to explore my portfolio, learn more about me or check out my projects page to see what I‚Äôve been working on lately. So whether you're here out of curiosity, collaboration, or inspiration, I hope you enjoy your stay ‚Äî feel free to take a look around and make yourself at home! Total Visits: Loading...
